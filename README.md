# entrypoint

Lightweight entry point for games.

### Why ?

- [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) is too heavy.
- [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) is way too OpenGL oriented.
- [TIGR](https://bitbucket.org/rmitton/tigr/src) is not developing :(

So let's take TIGR as a baseline, offload all rendering part to something like [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) and add iOS/Android support.

### Status

- WIP

### Additional

This library loosely based on TIGR.
